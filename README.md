The Redox project is an open-source, [QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard Firmware)](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware) powered, ergonomic split mechanical keyboard. This repository will be used to share information about the project and instruction on how to use and assembly the Redox keyboard.

**Designer's bio**: [Mattia Dal Ben (aka u/TiaMaT102)](mailto:matthewdibi@gmail.com) obtained a master's degree in Engineering Electronics with a specialization in Computer Science at the University of Udine. Currently works as a Software Engineer in R&D department for a big IoT and Embedded Computers company. Mechanical keyboard enthusiast and maker, the Redox keyboard is the result of all of his passions.

## Rationale

The Redox is a keyboard project designed with ergonomics in mind. It uses Cherry MX style mechanical switches laid out in a 7x5 columnar stagger layout with components that can easily be sourced. 

The design was heavily inspired by the [Ergodox keyboard](https://www.ergodox.io/), and its main goal is to reduce the size without sacrificing too many keys, hence the name **Re**duced Ergo**dox**. 

As an Ergodox user I couldn't ignore the few flaws of the original design and in a moment of arrogance I tried to fix them, thus the Redox features:
- Easier to reach thumb cluster.
- Additional easy-to-reach rotated 1.25u thumb key.
- Reduced size.
- Reduced costs (the Redox uses Arduino Pro Micro instead of the Teensy 2.0).
- Either half can be plugged in to the PC since each half can act as the master.
- Either half can work as a standalone keyboard to be used as a macropad/gaming keyboard.
- RGB backlighting support.
- 3D-printer friendly case.

#### Assembly

<p align="center">
<img src="img/redox-pcb2.jpg" alt="Redox PCBs" width="600"/>
</p>

Installation steps:

- Solder components:
  1. Solder 1N4148 diodes. Keep the diode legs for the right hand controller installation.
  2. Solder PJ-320A connectors.
  3. Solder momentary switches.
  4. Solder 4.7k Ohm resistors **on one half only**. If you are going for the RGB-underglow ignore this step.
  5. Solder the Pro Micro header pins (**do not solder the Pro Micro controllers yet**). This step may differ depending on which case your're using. Refer to the following:
    * See 3D-Printed case [right hand controller installation detail](#3d-printed-case-assembly).
    * See Falbatech's [bamboo case](#falbatechs-bamboo-case-assembly).
  6. Optional see [RGB-underglow instructions](#rgb-underglow).
- Flip the PCBs.
- Solder switches to the PCB.
- Flip the PCBs again.
- Solder Pro Micros to the header pins following the PCB labelling.

</p>

#### 3D-Printed-case-assembly

For the Pro Micro installation on the right hand use the diodes legs leftover from previous steps as this will make the controller's USB port much closer to the PCB, this is needed for the USB connector to fit in the 3D printed case. If you're using Falbatech's bamboo case this is not needed and you can use standard header pins. Right-hand-controller-installation-detail:

1. Use a breadboard to keep the diode's legs from falling.
2. Solder the diode's legs in place. You want to have the Pro Micro as close to the Redox's PCB as possible.
3. Cut the excess.
4. Apply some electrical tape under the controller to prevent shorts.
5. Install your preferred switches (**remember: the controller installation is the last step**).
6. Solder the controllers in place.

</p>

#### Firmware

The Redox uses QMK for its firmware, follow the QMK installation instructions [here](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/getting_started_build_tools), then compile and burn the firmware as follows:

```sh
$ cd path/to/qmk_firmware
$ make redox/rev1:default:avrdude
```

You can find the code for the Redox here: [QMK - Redox keyboard](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/redox).

In the [firmware/](https://github.com/mattdibi/redox-keyboard/tree/master/firmware) folder I added some pre-built hex files with the default keymap for testing purpose.

##### Setting EE_hands to use either hands as master
If you define `EE_HANDS` in your `config.h`, you will need to set the EEPROM for the left and right halves.

The EEPROM is used to store whether the half is left handed or right handed. This makes it so that the same firmware file will run on both hands instead of having to flash left and right handed versions of the firmware to each half. To flash the EEPROM file for the left half run:
```
$ cd path/to/qmk/folder
$ avrdude -p atmega32u4 -P $(COM_PORT) -c avr109 -U eeprom:w:keyboards/lets_split/eeprom-lefthand.eep

```
and similarly for right half
```
$ avrdude -p atmega32u4 -P $(COM_PORT) -c avr109 -U eeprom:w:keyboards/lets_split/eeprom-righthand.eep
```

**Note**: replace `$(COM_PORT)` with the port of your device (e.g. `/dev/ttyACM0`)

After you have flashed the EEPROM, you then need to set `EE_HANDS` in `keyboard/redox/keymaps/default/config.h` like so:

```c++
// ...
/* Use I2C or Serial, not both */

// #define USE_SERIAL
#define USE_I2C

/* Select hand configuration */

// #define MASTER_LEFT
// #define MASTER_RIGHT
#define EE_HANDS

#undef RGBLED_NUM
#define RGBLIGHT_ANIMATIONS
// ...
```

#### RGB-Underglow

Parts:
- [ ] WS2812/WS2812B LED strip
- [ ] 24 AWG (or smaller) stranded wire (white, red, black are good choices)

Data connection:

```
Led strip Headers -> DIN -> DO -> TRRS pad -> (TRRS to other side) -> TRRS pad -> DIN
```

Installation steps:

##### LEFT hand as master (usually plugged in to the PC)
- On the LEFT hand:
  1. Solder the LED Strip headers as seen in the pictures below.
  2. Solder the DO Pin of the RGB strip to the TRRS pad as seen in the figures below.
- On the RIGHT hand:
  1. Solder VCC and GND of the RGB strip to the LED Strip headers.
  2. Solder the DIN Pin of the RGB strip to the TRRS pad as seen in the figures below.
- Flash the firmware with the serial and RGB Backlight options on, specifying the number of LEDs installed (see instruction here).

##### Left hand back side:
<p align="center">
<img src="img/rgb-underglow1.jpg" alt="RGB underglow left hand backside" width="600"/>
</p>

##### Right hand back side:

<p align="center">
<img src="img/rgb-underglow2.jpg" alt="RGB underglow left hand backside" width="600"/>
</p>

##### RIGHT hand as master.
- On the RIGHT hand:
  1. Solder the LED Strip headers to the RGB strip.
  2. Solder the DO Pin of the RGB strip to the TRRS pad.
- On the LEFT hand:
  1. Solder VCC and GND of the RGB strip to the LED Strip headers.
  2. Solder the DIN Pin of the RGB strip to the TRRS pad.

**Notes**:
- You don't need to solder the 4.7k resistors since the I2C connection won't be used.
- You can use only one hand as master.

##### RGB Underglow firmware

To enable RGB backlighting you need to modify the default firmware as follows:
- Use serial communication instead of I2C.
- Set the master hand.
- Set the number of LED you installed.

To do this, modify `qmk_firmware/keyboards/redox/keymaps/default/config.h` as follows:

```c++
// ...

/* You need to use the sarial communication since we 
used a cable to carry the data signal for the LED strip */
#define USE_SERIAL

/* Select hand configuration: you need to use as master 
the hand that drives the LED strip */
#define MASTER_LEFT
// #define MASTER_RIGHT

/* Put the total number of led used here */
#undef RGBLED_NUM
#define RGBLIGHT_ANIMATIONS
#define RGBLED_NUM 14
#define RGBLIGHT_HUE_STEP 8
#define RGBLIGHT_SAT_STEP 8
#define RGBLIGHT_VAL_STEP 8

// ...
```

Then compile and burn the firmware on both controllers:

```sh
$ cd path/to/qmk_firmware
$ make redox/rev1:default:avrdude
```

### 3D-printed case

To lower the build costs I designed a 3D printable case which you can find in this repository or on [thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2886662), feel free to modify it to best suit your needs.

<p align="center">
<img src="img/3d-printed-case.jpg" alt="3D printed case" width=600 />
</p>

**Note**: I discourage the use of the rev.1's 3D printable case for a handwire, the plate is too thin and flexes too much as it's designed to be used with the PCB. Use the [Redox handwire case](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2704567) instead.

#### Rev 1.1 layout

This layout was designed to reduce the amount of 1.25 keycaps needed for the keyboard. Keycaps needed:
- 8x 1.25u keycaps
- 6x 1.5u keycaps
- 56x 1u keycaps

This layout is only available for the [Redox handwire version](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2704567) ... for now.
